# random_password_generator
This is a random password generator program that I created in Python to test my
understanding of for loops and using for loops with Python lists and range()
function.

# How does this program work?
This program ask user for input for how many letters, numbers and symbols 
they would have in their password. Based on the user input, this program 
generates a random password.
